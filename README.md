# API Valorize Team

### A good team is a united team, in which each of the participants knows their importance to the project, but it's hard to talk openly about other people's positive points, but that's the idea of this project. An api for users (people from the team) to register and share positive tags so everyone can give praise to a certain person.

Getting Started
=================

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
